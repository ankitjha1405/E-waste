# E-waste

# PROBLEM STATEMENT:-  
Increase in E-waste in our nature leads to various problems and health hazards. 

So, we the students of first year and we had tried to create a responsive E-commerce website where people can sell their E-waste. 
Yes we are trying to make people sell their waste product to those who can remanufacture it or to those can use it for their lab researchs.
For example:-

Bill is a person who owns a repair shop in his locality. He used to reapir mobile phones of other people. So he always needs of different parts of mobiles and laptops in cheap rates so that he can earn a good profit of it. Our aim is to make him happy by providing him broken phones and laptops (which are worth waste to general people) to him. By this both bill and general people will earn money.

The judge Vrijraj Singh sir had asked us a question last day that who is our market? 
At that time we hadn't thought about our market but after a little bit research we get to the point that we will focus on Middle-class people. As for them rs. 10 is also valueable. So the product which has no use to them, the product which they were considering a waste and are going to throw it in a dustbin, they will realise that they can sell that waste product and also can earn some money.

This website consist of certain languages:-
1.HTML
2.CSS
3.Java Script


# Methodology:-

Basically in the website we will ask the user to create a profile and when he wants to sell his damaged products he has to made apply for it and has to send us the photos of damaged products so that we can verify it and we will be at his door offering them some money if we found that the product can be reused. Then after we will provide the same to those who will book that product by having our own margin between the transfer of products. Also we can ask people to recommend this website to other and we will give them points on the basis of their recommendation and also they will also get points when they give their products to us. And when they collect a particular number of point we will send them any voucher/ gift cards/ T-shirts etc. We will be generating a proper amount of margin so that we can pay the transfer charges to the workers. And we can also create another method of generating money by showing some advertisements to the people before they can apply form their products to be reviewed.
